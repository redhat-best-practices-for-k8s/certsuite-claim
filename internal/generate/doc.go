/*
Package generate is responsible for generating GoLang representations of the test-network-function claim defined by
`claim-schema.json`.  A modified version of `https://github.com/a-h/generate` is utilized to emit GoLang structs
and their corresponding `MarshallJSON` and `UnmarshallJSON` interface implementations.  A modified version was
utilized since the original version (`https://github.com/a-h/generate`) blindly remaps JSON "object" types to GoLang
structs.  In this case, we have no struct definition for some facets of our claim, such as "LshwOutput" and
"JunitResults". This is due to the fact that others define those JSON structures, and we are not in the business of
redefinition.  This is a rare case in which we want to allow GoLang to represent arbitrary JSON data.  If deeper
meaning is needed for such properties at a later point, GoLang provides a reflection interface which can aid in
providing more granular type information.
